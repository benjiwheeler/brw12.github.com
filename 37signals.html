    <div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;">
    <div id="reasons-one">
<ol>
    <li><p class="title">Useful is forever</p>
<p class="description">Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
    </li>        

<li><p class="title">Great service is everything</p>
<p class="description">We&rsquo;re famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.</p>
    </li>

<li><p class="title">Clarity is king</p>
<p class="description">Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</p>
    </li>

<li><p class="title">Our customers are our investors</p>
<p class="description">Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them &mdash; not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>

<div id="reasons-two">
    <ol start=6>

<li><p class="title">The basics are beautiful</p>
<p class="description">We&rsquo;ll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer&rsquo;s time, money, and trust.</p>
    </li>
<li><p class="title">No hidden fees or secret prices</p>
<p class="description">We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</p>
    </li>

<li><p class="title">Software should be easy</p>
<p class="description">Our products are intuitive. You&rsquo;ll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don&rsquo;t sell you training because you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
    </li>

<li><p class="title">Long-term contracts are obscene</p>
<p class="description">No one likes being locked into something they don&rsquo;t want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</p>
