Customers
Meet some customers
Millions of entrepreneurs, freelancers, small businesses, and departments inside big organizations rely on our web apps.


Our loyal customers include designers, developers, freelancers, lawyers, accountants, architects, non-profits, charities, universities, PR firms, retailers, manufacturers, consultants, authors, publishers, government agencies, students, marketers, airlines, restaurants, filmmakers, farmers, and just about everyone in-between.

The world’s most popular brands depend on our products every day. We’ll never take their trust — or your trust — for granted.



We built the company that we’d want to do business with. We hope you do too.

1
Useful is forever
Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don’t.
2
Great service is everything
We’re famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.
3
Clarity is king
Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
4
Our customers are our investors
Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them — not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
5
The basics are beautiful
We’ll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer’s time, money, and trust.
6
No hidden fees or secret prices
We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
7
Software should be easy
Our products are intuitive. You’ll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don’t sell you training because you don’t need it.
8
Long-term contracts are obscene
No one likes being locked into something they don’t want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.

— Mark Cuban, co-founder HDNet, owner of the Dallas Mavericks
“The wisdom in these pages is edgy yet simple, straightforward, and proven. Read this book multiple times to help give you the courage you need to get out there and make something great.”
